## Basic Guidelines
### Always test your changes
   Do not submit your PR without at least running Minecraft with the RP on and make sure everything looks good.

### Stay in FlameRender Studios
   This is a community project, for this reason, we need you to stay in touch with the other members and me to communicate about the changes.

### Do not make large changes before discussing them first.
   If you're changing large amounts of code, please discuss it with me via. Github or Discord (Eldeston#3590) or in **FlameRender Studio Discord** in #super-duper-resource-pack.

## RP Style Guidelines
   There are 3 main roles each with different skills required to contribute to this project.

   * Texture artists - As the name implies, they design and replicate the textures of SDGP
   * PBR texture artists - Like texture artists, but specializes in making PBR materials to make the textures (or blocks in this case) be reflective, metallic, etc.
   * 3D model artists - As the name implies, they design the model of certain entities or blocks

   Each one must also follow the following guidelines/rules when participating this project.

### For texture artists
   * Use the vanilla color palette of that block to recreate or replicate (the iron block is an exception since it looks more like copper in the sneak peak, the solution to that is make copper use that texture instead)
   * If the block is not possible to replicate due to the lack of referrences or data, try to make new one that suits with the vanilla style and fits with the rest of the textures. You may use data from other Minecraft titles such as Minecraft Dungeons.
   * The texture should always be 32x32

### For PBR texture artists
   * Use the latest labPBR format as #super-duper-resource-pack also uses this format.
   * Make only the normal map, F0, roughness, emissiveness, ambient map, and height map (you may make a material mask for porosity but it's not necessary for now)
   * The texture should always be 32x32

### For model artists
   * Stay vanilla, no circles, or rounded edges. Keep it Minecraft:tm:
   * No high poly models. Keep everything minimal and optimized for minimal performance

   All 3 roles must work together, share as much intel with each other like picture or video references, and share ideas. Whether you are any of the 3 roles, please report and submit your work and ping me or issue it on the repository and I will commit your texture with your name to credit.

   If you haven't been verified and given the role @SDGP, please ping or DM me with your work attached and what role do you want to participate as.
